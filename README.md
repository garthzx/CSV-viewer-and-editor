### Note 1.0: The application is not completely done. As of now, it can only import *.csv* files and be viewed and edited. Next plans are exporting *.csv* files. 

### Note 1.1: The application is still not completely done, but major features have been added such as exporting *.csv* files, keyboard shortcuts for exiting the app, and a resizable table for long strings in cells. I am still thinking for the next steps of my application. 

A GUI app for viewing and editing CSV files :)
